# Review-Summarization-Analysis
In this project, a comprehensive study was conducted to assess different text summarization techniques, encompassing Word Frequency, BART, PEGASUS, and LSTM-based models. Notably, the Word Frequency-based summarization model exhibited superior performance compared to the BART and PEGASUS models, achieving a Rouge precision score of 0.05 and a recall score of 0.21. Beyond text summarization, the project extended its scope to include sentiment analysis using the Vader tool and the implementation of unsupervised K-means clustering following TF-IDF feature extraction. Throughout the project, a proficiency in essential areas such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, sentiment analysis, and the application of unsupervised clustering techniques was demonstrated.
